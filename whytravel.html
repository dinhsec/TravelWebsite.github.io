        <h1 id="articleTitle">Why Should You Travel?</h1>
        <p id="whySummary">Travel should be meaningful. It should excite and inspire you, rejuvenate and ground you, educate and challenge you, and most of all, it should humble you.Travel gives us our greatest stories, our most cherished memories and countless irreplaceable learnings that we can choose to pay forward to others. It teaches us about ourselves and each other, it broadens our horizons and, just like a reset button, it forces us to refocus on what really matters. <b><em>-Claire Trickett</em></b></p>
